# AWS CloudFormation

## Overview
AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to model, provision, and manage AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates. It simplifies resource management by enabling repeatable, automated deployments.

### Key Features
- **Declarative Infrastructure** – Define AWS resources in YAML or JSON.
- **Automated Provisioning** – Deploy resources consistently across environments.
- **Drift Detection** – Identify configuration changes outside of CloudFormation.
- **Rollback Support** – Automatically revert to a previous state if deployments fail.
- **Stack Management** – Group and manage AWS resources logically.

## Example: Creating an S3 Bucket Using CloudFormation (YAML)
Below is an example of how to define an S3 bucket using a CloudFormation template:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-cloudformation-bucket
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
```

To deploy this template, use the AWS CLI:
```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name MyStack --template-body file://template.yaml
```

## How CDK and Terraform Use CloudFormation
### AWS CDK
AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies writing CloudFormation templates using programming languages like TypeScript, Python, and Java. When a CDK application is deployed, it **synthesizes CloudFormation templates** behind the scenes.

#### Example: Creating an S3 Bucket Using AWS CDK (TypeScript)
```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

export class S3Stack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyS3Bucket', {
      bucketName: 'my-cdk-bucket',
      versioned: true,
    });
  }
}
```

### Terraform
Terraform is another Infrastructure as Code tool that supports AWS and many other cloud providers. While Terraform does not directly generate CloudFormation templates, it **interacts with AWS APIs** in a similar way, managing resources declaratively.

#### Example: Creating an S3 Bucket Using Terraform
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-bucket"
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

### Key Differences Between CloudFormation, CDK, and Terraform
| Feature             | CloudFormation | AWS CDK | Terraform |
|--------------------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Language Support  | YAML, JSON    | TypeScript, Python, Java, etc. | HCL |
| AWS Native        | Yes           | Yes     | No (supports multiple providers) |
| Flexibility       | Moderate      | High    | High |
| Abstraction Level | Low           | High    | Medium |
| Multi-Cloud       | No            | No      | Yes |

## Best Practices
- **Use Stacks and StackSets** – Organize resources efficiently across AWS accounts and regions.
- **Implement Parameters and Outputs** – Make templates reusable and dynamic.
- **Enable Stack Rollback** – Ensure failed deployments revert to a stable state.
- **Use AWS Config and Drift Detection** – Monitor for unexpected changes to infrastructure.
- **Leverage CDK or Terraform** – Simplify infrastructure management with higher-level abstractions.
