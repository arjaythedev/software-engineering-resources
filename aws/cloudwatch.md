# AWS CloudWatch

## Overview
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides real-time insights into AWS resources and applications. It helps collect and analyze metrics, logs, and events to keep systems running smoothly and securely.

### Key Features
- **Metrics Monitoring** – Collect and track key performance data from AWS services.
- **Log Management** – Aggregate, store, and analyze logs from applications and AWS resources.
- **Alarms and Notifications** – Set thresholds and trigger alerts via SNS, email, or other integrations.
- **Dashboards** – Create custom visualizations for monitoring AWS environments.
- **Automated Actions** – Take automated responses based on predefined conditions.

## Example: Creating a CloudWatch Alarm Using AWS CDK (TypeScript)
Below is an example of how to create a CloudWatch alarm for monitoring CPU utilization using AWS CDK in TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as cloudwatch from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

export class CloudWatchStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const instance = new ec2.Instance(this, 'MyEC2Instance', {
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.T3, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),
      machineImage: ec2.MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux2(),
      vpc: new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVPC', { maxAzs: 2 }),
    });

    new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'CPUUtilizationAlarm', {
      metric: instance.metricCpuUtilization(),
      threshold: 80,
      evaluationPeriods: 2,
      alarmDescription: 'Alarm when CPU utilization exceeds 80%',
      alarmName: 'HighCPUAlarm',
    });
  }
}
```

## Use Case Example: Monitoring a Web Application
Imagine you run an online store and want to ensure that your application remains available and responsive to users. AWS CloudWatch can help by:

1. **Monitoring EC2 Instances** – Track CPU, memory, and disk usage to ensure servers handle traffic efficiently.
2. **Detecting High Latency** – Set up alarms for increased response times and API failures.
3. **Analyzing Logs** – Store and search application logs to troubleshoot performance issues.
4. **Scaling Applications Automatically** – Trigger Auto Scaling when CPU or memory usage spikes.
5. **Notifying Support Teams** – Send real-time alerts to email, Slack, or PagerDuty when issues arise.

With AWS CloudWatch, your online store remains available, and performance bottlenecks can be detected before they impact customers.

## CloudWatch Metrics
CloudWatch provides built-in metrics for various AWS services, including:
- **EC2** – CPU Utilization, Network Traffic, Disk I/O.
- **RDS** – Read/Write Latency, Free Storage Space, Connection Count.
- **Lambda** – Invocation Count, Duration, Error Rate.
- **DynamoDB** – Read/Write Throughput, Throttled Requests.
- **S3** – Bucket Size, Number of Objects, Request Count.

## CloudWatch Logs and Insights
- **CloudWatch Logs** – Collect and centralize application logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **CloudWatch Insights** – Query and analyze log data to detect patterns and anomalies.
- **Log Retention Policies** – Define how long logs should be retained to optimize storage costs.

## Best Practices
- **Set Up Alarms for Key Metrics** – Monitor resource usage and automate actions when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Enable Detailed Monitoring** – Collect high-resolution metrics for improved visibility.
- **Use Log Insights for Troubleshooting** – Quickly identify root causes of performance issues.
- **Optimize Costs** – Use metric filters and retention policies to reduce log storage expenses.
- **Automate Responses** – Integrate CloudWatch with AWS Lambda for automatic issue resolution.
