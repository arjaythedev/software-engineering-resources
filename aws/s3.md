# AWS S3

## Overview
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that offers scalability, security, and performance. It is widely used for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

### Key Features
- **Scalable Storage** – Store unlimited amounts of data with automatic scaling.
- **High Durability** – Designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.
- **Multiple Storage Classes** – Optimize cost and performance with different storage options.
- **Secure by Default** – Supports encryption, IAM policies, and access control lists (ACLs).
- **Data Lifecycle Management** – Automate data migration and expiration policies.

## Example: Creating an S3 Bucket Using AWS CDK (TypeScript)
Below is an example of how to create an S3 bucket using AWS CDK in TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

export class S3Stack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyS3Bucket', {
      bucketName: 'my-example-bucket',
      versioned: true,
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.RETAIN,
      lifecycleRules: [{
        transitions: [{
          storageClass: s3.StorageClass.GLACIER,
          transitionAfter: cdk.Duration.days(90),
        }],
      }],
    });
  }
}
```

## S3 Use Case: Image & Video Storage for a Social Media App
A **photo-sharing app** needs to store and serve millions of images and videos efficiently. Using **Amazon S3**, the app can handle large-scale media storage.

## How S3 Helps
1. **Scalable Storage** – Handles unlimited images and videos without worrying about capacity.
2. **Cost-Effective** – Uses S3 Standard for frequently accessed images and Glacier for long-term storage.
3. **Global Access** – Content is available worldwide with low latency.
4. **Security & Privacy** – Restricts access using IAM policies and signed URLs.
5. **Automatic Backups & Versioning** – Prevents accidental deletions and maintains content history.

By using S3, the app delivers a **fast, reliable, and secure media experience**.

## S3 Versioning
S3 Versioning is a feature that allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of an object stored in a bucket. When versioning is enabled:
- Multiple versions of an object are retained.
- It helps protect against accidental deletions or overwrites.
- Supports MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) delete for extra security.

### Enabling Versioning via AWS CLI
```sh
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-example-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

## S3 Glacier
S3 Glacier is a low-cost cloud storage service for data archiving and long-term backup. It provides three retrieval options:
- **Expedited (1–5 minutes retrieval time)** – For urgent data access.
- **Standard (3–5 hours retrieval time)** – Cost-effective for occasional retrievals.
- **Bulk (5–12 hours retrieval time)** – Best for large-scale retrievals.

### Lifecycle Policy for Archiving Data to Glacier
You can configure lifecycle rules to automatically transition objects to Glacier after a certain period:
```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "MoveToGlacier",
      "Prefix": "backup/",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 90,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices
- **Enable Versioning** – Protect against accidental deletions and overwrites.
- **Use Lifecycle Policies** – Automate data transitions to cost-effective storage classes.
- **Enable Server-Side Encryption** – Secure stored data using SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C.
- **Implement IAM Policies** – Restrict access based on user roles and least privilege principles.
- **Enable Logging and Monitoring** – Use S3 access logs and AWS CloudTrail for security auditing.
