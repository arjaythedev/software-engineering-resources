# 15 Days of Networking Basics

Welcome to **15 Days of Networking Basics**! This repository is a beginner-friendly journey through the essentials of computer networking, tailored for software engineers. Over 15 days, you'll find one Markdown file per day, each breaking down a key networking concept into digestible pieces. Whether you're building web apps, debugging distributed systems, or just curious about how data moves around the internet, this series is for you. This GitHub series is paired with my [networking series on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arjay_the_dev/), where I share visuals and quick tips to complement these lessonsâ€”follow along there too!

## Why Networking Matters for Software Engineers

As a software engineer, you might wonder, "Why should I care about networking? I just write code!" But hereâ€™s the thing: networking is the backbone of almost everything you build or interact with. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s worth your time:

- **Building Efficient Applications**: Understanding how data travels (e.g., between a client and server) helps you optimize performance and reduce latency.
- **Debugging Like a Pro**: Ever seen a "Connection Timed Out" error? Knowing networking basics lets you pinpoint if itâ€™s your code, the network, or something else.
- **Distributed Systems**: Microservices, cloud computing, and APIs all rely on networks. Youâ€™ll design better systems if you get how they communicate.
- **Security Awareness**: Networks are where attacks like DDoS or man-in-the-middle happen. A little knowledge goes a long way in writing secure code.
- **Real-World Relevance**: From deploying an app to configuring a local dev environment, networking pops up everywhere.

In short, networking isnâ€™t just for sysadminsâ€”itâ€™s a superpower for software engineers who want to level up their skills and understand the bigger picture.

## The 15-Day Plan

Below is the roadmap for this series. Iâ€™ll add a new file each day, linked here for easy access. So far, weâ€™ve got Day 1 readyâ€”check it out!

- **Day 1: [WAN vs LAN](./wan_vs_lan.md)**  
  Learn the difference between Wide Area Networks (WAN) and Local Area Networks (LAN), and why it matters.
- **Day 2:** *Coming soon!*  
- **Day 3:** *Coming soon!*  
- **Day 4:** *Coming soon!*  
- **Day 5:** *Coming soon!*  
- **Day 6:** *Coming soon!*
